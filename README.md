# Git Commands Cheatsheet

This is a cheatsheet of github commands described in a way that I would be able to understand.

- `git status`						          shows the status of your staging area.
- `git add -A`  or  `git add .` 				 adds all of your changes into the staging area.
- `git commit -m “your message here”`			 commits your file changes into the selected branch.
- `git push -u origin <branch-name>`			 pushes the the selected local branch into the remote repository.

- `git clone <repository link> <directory>`			 downloads a clone of the repository into your computers directory.
- `git branch`						 lists all of your branches.
- `git branch -a`						 lists all of the cloned repository’s branches both remotely and locally.
- `git branch <new branch name>`				 creates a new local branch.
- `git pull origin master`					 updates your cloned repository’s master branch to be in line with the online repos branch.
- `git push origin master`					 updates the online repository master branch with the changes you made to your local master branch.
- `git checkout <branch-name>`				 switches your working branch into “branch-name” locally.
